Responsive Mastermind – HTML/CSS/JS

In my first year at HETIC, my Front-End teacher challenged us to do a Mastermind, based on our skills in Front-end developpement.

What’s the rules of my Mastermind ?
The player has to guess a random combination of four colours among red, blue, green, yellow and orange, that can be repeated. To do it, the player has ten chances. The computer will have to give clues for every guess.


•	Red point means that a colour is good, and at the right place (if you have four you WIN)


•	White point means that a colour is good, but at the wrong place


•	No point means that a colour doesn’t exist in the computer sequence

In this example, the player has one colour at the right place, two colours at the wrong place, and one colour that doesn't exist in the computer sequence.

You can restart the game by pressing the button “Rejouer”, you can also reset your sequence by pressing the “RESET” button. 
As a fan of the original game, I worked on the design to make it look like the real game. This is my first JavaScript game, I think I will update this version based on what I will learn during the rest of my school period.
